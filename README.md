The Hotel Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to streamline hotel operations through a user-friendly interface. Built with Java Swing, it supports multiple user roles (Admin, Reception, and Guest portal placeholder) and manages key entities like customers, rooms, employees, drivers, and reservations. The system uses a dark-themed UI for modern aesthetics and file-based data persistence for simplicity. It provides CRUD operations, real-time reporting, and workflow automation for efficient hotel administration, making it suitable for small to medium-sized hotels seeking digital transformation.
